## Course Materials and Communication
There is no required textbook for the course, but there will be an assortment of handouts and online readings that you will receive over the course of the semester. They will be uploaded to (or linked from) this Github site. 

We will be assigning a number of tutorials from the [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com) website, which you can access for free using your RIT login. 

Most course materials and example code will be distributed via Github, and you will also be learning how to use Git and Github to manage your own exercise and project files.

MyCourses will also be used for announcements, certain assignment submissions, and grading.

As this is a course on using Web technologies, you will be expected to publish assignments online using RIT's public-facing Web environment.

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory and you are expected to be on time. Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and will be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early).

## Grading
Final course grades are determined using the following scale: 

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+%	| A |
| 80+%	| B |
| 70+%	| C |
| 65+%	| D |
| <65%	| F |

### Projects (50%)
* Project 1 (10%) - [Game Proposal Site](projects/project-1.md)
* Project 2 (10%) - [Web Service Application](projects/project-2.md)
* Project 3 (10%) - [Web Portfolio](projects/project-3.md)
* Project 4 (20%) - [Interactive Game or Experience](projects/project-4.md)


### Exams (30%)
These exams consist of short answer, multiple choice, and "write some code" questions. There will be no make-ups or re-takes allowed without prior permission.
* Written Midterm Exam  - will be given during the 8th week of the semester
* Written Final Exam - will be given on the last regular class meeting of the semester

### Homework (15%)
Completing the HW and in-class exercises is essential to learning the course material. You can expect an average of one HW assignment per class meeting. Keep an eye on the mycourses dropboxes for the dues dates of these assignments.

Homework and ICEs will NOT be accepted late without a valid excuse (procrastination, and missing the dropbox by 1 minute, are not valid excuses). 

If you feel you have legitimate excuse, please contact the professor in **advance** of the due date either by email or during office hours.

**Important!** - When you submit web file(s) (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) to mycourses dropboxes, they (or the folder they are contained in) must be zipped (not .tar, .rar, .gzip, .sit, etc) If you do not do so, mycourses will strip out all of the CSS and JavaScript, and leave you with a non-functioning and ugly web page. Unzipped assignments will therefore usually receive a grade of zero.

### Attendance & Participation (5%)
Note: 1 absence 4/5 points, 2 absences 3/5 points, 3 absences 1.5/5 points, 4 absences 0/5 points. **Each additional absence is 5% off of final average.** Arriving late is 1/2 absence. Facebooking or similar off-task activity during lectures or demos will count as an absence for the day. If you have a legitimate reason for missing class, notify your professor in advance of the class meeting.

### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, soley for issues that arise AFTER the 'W' deadline has passed at the end of week 11, and then only by prior arrangement with the professor. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework is not sufficient justification for an "I". Instead, meet with the professor ASAP as early as possible in the semester if you're having difficulty. 

### Academic Dishonesty
The course policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing, you get an "F" as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.) Please review RIT's policy on academic dishonesty: 
[http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html](http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html)

## Important RIT Deadlines
- Last day of add/drop is Tuesday September 4th, 2018.
- Last day to withdraw with a grade of "W" is Friday November 9th, 2018.
- You have one semester after the class has ended to challenge your grade. 

## Notices of Accommodation
If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", your professor should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met.
