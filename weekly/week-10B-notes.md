## III. Discussion - *What do you put in your portfolio?*
1. For the portfolio project, you are going to utilize templates to create a web portfolio that showcases your work to potential employers. 
    - **Important:** Templates are OK for Game Developers and Web Developers/Interactive Developers, but if you are instead interested in working as a **web designer** or similar, at some point you will need to create a *custom* website and forego CSS templates. Here is a valuable course you should check out on Lynda.com: [https://www.lynda.com/Behance-tutorials/Welcome/642472/704251-4.html](https://www.lynda.com/Behance-tutorials/Welcome/642472/704251-4.html)
1. Think about what you want the site to do for you. What is its *mission*? What is the *goal* of the site?
    - to get a specific co-op or job or career?
        - ex. Game Designer, Game Developer, Combat Designer, Software Engineer, Web Developer, Mobile Developer, Creative Developer, Creative Technolgist, Simulations Developer ...
    - to work in a specific industry? 
        - AAA Game, Indie Game, Creative/Consulting/Marketing firm, Defense
    - or at a specific company?
        - ex. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Sony - Barbarian Group, Odopod, Sapient Razorfish ...
    - or work for yourself (freelance)?
1. Craft a tagline or mission statement, just one or 2 sentences, that supports the goal of the site:

1. The portfolio is a *story*, everything you put on the site says *something* about *you*. Be sure that the portfolio is telling a story that *helps* you, not one that *hurts* you.
    - **Curate your projects** and focus on the ones that make you look qualified for your dream job:
      - Show only your **best work**
      - Show relevant work. Are you looking for a coding job? Then don't feature that sword you made in the 3D animation class!
      - Be careful about selecting HW assignments as portfolio pieces unless they are substantially different from or better than what your peers did on the same assignment - recruiters have probably seen them multiple times!
      - Show diverse work
      - Think about the sequence - put the focus on your best work - showcase your best project
1. Curated Projects - show them in context:
    - With a web game or other interactive work, link to the actual application, don't just show screen shots
    - Create YouTube demo videos for your games that are not published to the Web
    - Have supporting text that explains what the project does, and its inspiration
1. Consider showing your development *process* - this gives employers insight into how you think as a designer (or coder or artist as applicable) - here are some ideas:
    - Concept images from sketchbook
    - Affinity maps/sticky notes
    - Screenshots and notes on prototypes
    - Pictures from user testing
1. For team-based work, clearly identify what *you* did on the project:
    - Be specific! 
    - Don't exaggerate!

- **Important:** Employers will look at your portfolio and make hiring decisions based on what *their* needs are, not yours, so make it easy for the recruiter to figure what you are good at!
