# Intro to PixiJS

## Overview
This week we will be getting ready for *Project 4: the Sprite-based Game* by looking at [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com), which is a high performance 2D rendering library that can be used to create games and interactive experiences in a web browser. 
We will also look at ES6 classes, which are another way to make object instances in JavaScript.

## Topics
- PixiJS
    - setting up a PixiJS application
    - drawing Shapes
    - drawing Images
    - buttons and Events
    - animating sprites
- ES 6 Classes
    - the `class`, `constructor`, `extends`, and `new` keywords
    - class inheritance
