# Week 6B - Navigation Design & Project 1 Critique

## I. Navigation Design

- 

## II. Project 1 Critique

- At this point, your [Project 1](../projects/project-1.md) should be substantially complete, maybe needing a few minor tweaks here and there. 
In an effort to improve it even further, today's class will be devoted entirely to project critiques. Critique is useful not only for you to receive and improve your work, but in the industry it's very important to be able to give good, constructive criticism, so we're going to be practicing here!

- Everyone should gather into groups of 3 to 4, and complete the critique exercise linked below. When you're done, submit your critique file to the appropriate dropbox in myCourses before the due date, and also seriously consider how you can implement your group's feedback into your site. Remember, you don't have to implement all of it, but it is all worth serious consideration.

## II-A. Exercise
- See myCourses for critique DOC
- Submit completed DOC to appropriate dropbox
