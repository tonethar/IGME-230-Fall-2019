# Week 3B - Review of CSS

## I. Topics & Overview
- [Project 1](../projects/project-1.md) requirements posted:
  - there is a myCourses discussion thread to post your idea
- LWD chapters 11-14 have been assigned:
  - there are active "Study Quizzes" in mycourses for you to take. These can be taken as many times as you want - and they are all open for at least a week
  - IMPORTANT: These are open book,  but you need to work solo on them, and not with any outside help. Making these quizzes a group effort or just giving the answers to a friend will end up hurting people in the near term because they won't know the material
- Review of `.htaccess` Authentication
- Finish LWD Chapter 5 - *Marking Up Text* slides
- LWD Chapter 6 - *Adding Links*
  - The `a` element
  - External links with absolute URLs
  - Links with relative pathnames
  - Linking within a page (fragments)
  - Targeting browser windows
  - Mail links
- Semantic HTML Demo (**fix the Unix page!**)
- Project 1 questions / work on HW
