# Week 1B - Review of *banjo.rit.edu* & FTP

## Topics
- FTP review
- Setting up your `230` directory
- Scripting the server with `.htaccess` files

## I. FTP Demo
FTP demo and review (we will do this together in class):
   - Create a local 230 directory, and put a *hello.html* file in it
   - **Reminder:** always keep backups, bring a flash drive to class; the `230` folder on people.rit.edu is where course work will usually be posted

**hello.html**
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Hello Page</title>
	<style>
	h1{
	  font-family:sans-serif;
	}
	</style>
</head>
   <body>
      <h1>Week 1 in 230!</h1>
      <p>I am stoked about this class!</p>
   </body>
</html>
```
 
1. connect to **`banjo.rit.edu`** with an FTP client - instructions are here: [How to post to RIT's *banjo* web server](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/tree/master/notes/posting-to-banjo.md)
1. create a **`230`** folder and place it in your **`www`** folder
1. post *hello.html* to your banjo **`230`** folder
1. review file/folder permissions to be sure they are correct
1. **Reminder:** **`banjo.rit.edu`** is the FTP name, but the browser will access the URL **`people.rit.edu`**
1. navigate a browser to that directory - **`http://people.rit.edu/~abc1234/230/hello.html`** and you should see your *hello.html* page
1. remember CSS? Let's add some CSS style rules to the page!

## II. Presentation
- [Auth and htaccess PDF](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/tree/master/docs/Auth-and-htaccess.pdf)

## III. htaccess Demo
*A .htaccess ("hypertext access") file is a directory-level configuration file supported by the major web servers, used for configuration of site-access issues, such as URL redirection, URL shortening, Access-security control (for different webpages and files), and more.*

In class, let's take a look at what .htaccess files can do. We will look at the following htaccess directives:

1. `DirectoryIndex hello.html` - makes the default file for the folder *hello.html* rather than *index.html*
2. `Options -Indexes` - turns off file listing for folders so that users can't see your files and folders directly
3. `Header add X-HeaderName "Header Value"` - sends a custom header. `X-` is a convention used for naming non-standard headers
4. `Redirect /~acjvks/230/hello.html http://www.rit.edu` - redirects the browser from a file to another domain
5. `Redirect /~acjvks/230/ /~acjvks/110/` - redirects the browser from a folder, to a different folder
6. `ModPagespeed off` - turns off the ModPagespeed extension
