## III. Readings and Homework Assignments
- As always, keep an eye on the myCourses dropboxes, both the descriptions and due dates. These will help you keep track of what is due/when, and what you should be working on
- There are 3 more LWD Study Quizzes in myCourses - they cover Flex & CSS Grid - after these we are DONE with the textbook for this course (PS - I recommend that you keep the book and not sell it - the text could be a valuable reference in the future if you pursue web development or design as a career) 
- Submit all of the course assignments on time, even if they are not 100% right!
